### Interaction System
--------------------
A sphere collision volume was created on the player pawn. Inside my project settings I created a custom collision channel called 'Interactable'. Whenever I wanted to make an actor interactable, I first selected an actor's static mesh component or if the actor didn't have any mesh associated with it I would create a volume. Next, by creating an interface also called 'Interactable' with two methods: 'Interact' and 'Exit Interact'.
