## About Me

Hello there. My name's David, I'm 23 years old, and I hail from Ireland. 

## Gameplay Features
--------------------

### Interaction System
--------------------
*A sphere collision volume is created on the player pawn.
*Inside my project settings I created a custom collision channel called 'Interactable'.
*An interface also called 'Interactable' was created with two methods: 'Interact' and 'Exit Interact'.
*Whenever I wanted to make an actor interactable, I first selected an actor's static mesh component or if the actor didn't have any mesh associated with it I would create a volume. 
*Next, I'd implement the Interactable interface providing custom functionality for the actor in question.
